👋 Hi, I’m Dinesh Chavda — a Cybersecurity Analyst based in Hamilton, ON, Canada.
🔒 I specialize in threat hunting, incident response, and cloud security. My toolkit includes Microsoft Sentinel, IBM QRadar, SentinelOne, and Microsoft Defender.
☁️ I love designing secure cloud environments in Azure, building security automation, and creating lab setups for testing and learning.
🛠️ I also have experience in full-stack development (C#, Python Flask, HTML/CSS/JS) and enjoy building tools that make security operations more efficient.
🎯 Currently exploring new ways to automate security processes and improve threat detection techniques.
🚀 Open to collaborating on security projects, tools, or community initiatives. Let’s connect!
